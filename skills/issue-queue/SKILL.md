# Issue queue

You hold the queue. The development worker holds the code.

Before starting watches or workers, read the current client’s execution reference: [Claude Code](../orchestrate/references/claude.md) or [Codex](../orchestrate/references/codex.md). Read only that reference; use its development role and lifecycle.

Resolve `<skill-dir>` below to the absolute directory containing this issue-queue `SKILL.md`; substitute the path before running commands.

Work the queue until it is empty, then idle on the watch. Stop when the user says stop, or when you are **blocked**.

## Scope

`--map <n>` scopes the queue to one map: the open tickets that descend from map issue #n. The `wayfinder` skill writes the map.

| Argument | The queue |
|---|---|
| absent | every open issue with no parent |
| `--map <n>` | the open tickets under map #n |

A mapped issue never enters an unscoped queue. The two lanes are disjoint, so an unscoped queue and a `--map` queue run side by side and never race. Two unscoped queues still race each other.

A ticket descends from the map through sub-issues: map -> slice -> ticket. An issue with no parent belongs to no map. An issue a ticket files mid-flight goes under that ticket's slice, so it stays in this queue. One script reads both lanes, printing `<number>\t<title>`.

```bash
"<skill-dir>/scripts/queue-list.sh"              # the parentless issues
"<skill-dir>/scripts/queue-list.sh" --map <n>    # the open tickets under map #n
```

Pass the same flag everywhere. Bare `gh issue list` is never the queue — it returns the mapped issues too. Read each body with `gh issue view <n>`.

## 1 — Build the queue

Arm the watch first. An issue filed after this line still reaches you.

```bash
"<skill-dir>/scripts/watch-queue.sh" [--map <n>]
```

Retain its process handle and consume events using the current client’s watch mechanism. One event per issue number you have not seen. A reopened issue counts as new.

Then run `queue-list.sh` once and read every body with `gh issue view <n>`. Each issue lands in one lane.

| Lane | The issue |
|---|---|
| **Ready** | names the current behaviour, the wanted behaviour, and the surface it touches |
| **Skip** | needs a call only the user can make, duplicates another issue, or names no observable change |

Report the Skip lane, one line each with the reason. Then start the Ready lane on your own.

## 2 — Order the queue

An issue depends on another when it needs that issue's code, or edits the same function.

- A dependency runs before its dependants.
- Independent issues run smallest first.
- Two issues that edit the same lines are one issue. Merge them in the queue and say you did.

The **frontier** is every Ready issue whose code dependencies are merged or available in usable open PRs. Start on the dependency PR branch when its code is still unmerged. A dependency that requires a settled product decision or a live deployment remains blocked until that condition is met. Step 4 runs the frontier.

## 3 — Pick the base branch

The base is what makes the work stack. You choose it. `dev` runs the command, in its own worktree.

| The issue | Base | Command in the brief |
|---|---|---|
| needs no code from an open PR | trunk | `git switch -c <branch> <trunk>` |
| needs code from an open PR | that PR's branch | `gh stack checkout <PR#>` then `gh stack add <branch>` |

Reach for the stack. A branch cut from trunk that later needs an open PR's code costs a rebase and a second review.

`gh stack init <branch>` starts the first stack in a repo that has none.

## 4 — Run the frontier

`orchestrate` runs it, and `dev` is the worker. With no `--workers`, `orchestrate` sizes the fleet from the machine and moves it as the load moves. `--workers <n>` caps that climb. When a `dev` returns, prepare its PR (step 5), then recompute the frontier. Opening or preparing a PR does not mean it has merged.

Two frontier issues that turn out to touch the same function: hold the second until the first merges. Step 2 should have merged them.

Each brief carries what `orchestrate` asks for, plus:

- the issue number — `dev` reads the body itself with `gh issue view`
- the branch to cut, the base branch its PR targets, and the step 3 command that cuts it
- the instruction to open the PR with `gh pr create --base <base>`
- for a stacked issue: what the PR underneath already changed

## 5 — Prepare the PR

| The PR | Do |
|---|---|
| stacked | `gh stack sync` — it links the open PRs into one stack on GitHub and pushes the branches |
| from trunk | no stack sync needed; its PR enters the watch window when eligible |

Run `gh stack sync` again after a PR in the stack merges. It fast-forwards trunk and cascade-rebases what is left.

`gh stack view --short` reads the stack. `gh stack submit --auto` opens PRs without the interactive editor.

## 6 — Babysit the window

The user merges the oldest PR first. So the oldest open PR is the only one that can merge next, and a green PR behind it waits either way.

The **window** is the 5 oldest open PRs this queue filed. Run `pr` on those, and only those. This replaces the default: you do not babysit every PR you file.

```bash
gh pr list --state open --author "@me" --json number,createdAt --jq 'sort_by(.createdAt) | .[].number'
```

Oldest first, every PR you authored. Keep the ones this queue filed and take the first five. Another session's PR is not yours to watch, however old it is.

Five is the cap because each window PR holds its own watch, and every watch wakes every 30 seconds. A sixth watch buys noise, not a merge.

A `pr` watch exits on its own when the PR leaves `OPEN`. That event is what slides the window: take the next oldest PR then, and arm `pr` on it. Not before.

A stack merges bottom up, so its PRs already sit in the window in merge order.

## A new issue arrives

The watch fires mid-run. Read the body with `gh issue view <n>`, put it in a lane, and act.

| The new issue | Do |
|---|---|
| Skip lane | report the one line. Carry on |
| independent of the run in flight | slot it into the queue by the step 2 rules |
| a run in flight needs its code | interrupt that worker, take the new issue first, then resume or restart its task on the updated base |
| supersedes a run in flight | interrupt that worker, inspect and retain any reusable changes, re-triage both |

Interrupt only the worker the new issue collides with, using the current client’s lifecycle. The other agents keep working.

Never interrupt a `dev` run for an issue that only shares a file. The rebase costs less than the restart.

## Blocked

Three states are blocked. Report what you tried, take the next independent issue, and come back when the user answers.

- a rebase conflict that requires an unresolved product decision or unavailable input
- a gate that stays red for a reason the issue did not cause
- an issue that turns out to need a product call

## Report

After each PR, one line: the issue, the PR URL, its base, and whether it entered the window or waits.

When the queue empties, one table: issue, PR, base, state. Then the Skip lane, unchanged. Say the watch is still armed, and stay in the session.

When a `--map` queue empties, the current slice is done. Say so: the next slice waits on `wayfinder`, not on you.

When the user says stop or the run ends, stop its queue, PR, and load watches, interrupt its workers, and stop the processes they started. Report the same table with unfinished tasks.
