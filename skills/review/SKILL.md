description: Review a pull request someone else opened, post the review, and merge it on the user's word. Use when the user asks to review a PR, or to review and merge open PRs. Not for your own PR.

# Review

Other people file the PRs. The user reads reviews, not diffs.

```
list ──> smallest first ──> reviewer per PR, in parallel ──> post ──> merge on their word ──> next
```

## 1 — The list

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,author,additions,deletions,isDraft \
  --jq '.[] | select(.isDraft|not) | "\(.number)\t\(.additions+.deletions)\t\(.author.login)\t\(.title)"' | sort -t$'\t' -k2n
```

Smallest first. The user: "pick the ones that are less likely to have issues." Skip drafts and PRs the user named as not theirs to take.

## 2 — The review

Load `orchestrate` for capacity and isolation. Read the current client’s execution reference: [Claude Code](../orchestrate/references/claude.md) or [Codex](../orchestrate/references/codex.md), and use its reviewer role. Read only that client reference. One worker per PR, each in its own worktree for checkout and checks. The brief is the PR number and one line on what the user wants known. The worker returns the verdict, the findings, and what it ran.

Read the findings before you post. A worker's claim is a claim: open the line it names.

## 3 — Post

```bash
gh pr review <N> --request-changes --body-file <file>    # a blocker or a should
gh pr review <N> --approve --body-file <file>            # ship
```

The body: the verdict in one line, then the findings as the agent ranked them, `file:line` on each. What was run, last. No praise, no summary of the diff: the author wrote it.

A finding on one line goes inline, so the author sees it in place:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<N>/comments -f body="<finding>" -f commit_id="<head sha>" -f path="<file>" -F line=<line>
```

## 4 — Merge

The user merges, unless they said "merge". Then: green, approved, no open thread, on top of the base, and `gh pr merge <N> --rebase --delete-branch`. Oldest first, one at a time, and `gh pr list` again after each: a merge moves the base under the rest.

## Report

Per PR, one line: number, verdict, the blocker if any, merged or waiting. Then what needs the user: a product call a review turned up, a PR they asked about that is not theirs to merge.
