# Grilling

Grill the user relentlessly on the decisions that carry weight. Decide the rest yourself.

Map the work as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are settled. Split the frontier: the load-bearing decisions go to the user in one **round**, the rest you settle.

## Load-bearing

A decision is load-bearing when a wrong answer is expensive to undo, or when only the user holds the answer.

| Ask the user | Settle it yourself |
|---|---|
| What the product does, and for whom | How the code does it |
| The data model, the contract, who owns what | The library, the file layout, the naming |
| A one-way door: a migration, a vendor, a public API | Anything a later diff can change |
| A trade-off the user prices: cost, scope, who gets cut | An edge case with a safe default |
| How a new screen looks and moves, shown as a `prototype` he can flip through | The component, the token, the library, and every screen `DESIGN.md` already settles |
| Where the plan contradicts itself, or the product | A gap a reasonable assumption closes |

The user does not hold the tech stack, and does not want to. A question he would answer with "you decide" was never load-bearing.

The filter cuts the volume, not the depth. Grill hard on what passes it: push back, take the other side, find the contradiction.

## Words

Use the words the user typed, and the names the code already has. A word the user has to ask about costs a round.

## The round

| Rule | Because |
|---|---|
| One round holds the whole load-bearing frontier | The user answers once, not question by question |
| Every question carries your recommended answer | The user answers by exception |
| A question that waits on another open question goes to a later round | Its answer would be a guess |
| A fact from the environment goes to a subagent, never to the user | Facts are your job. Decisions are the user's |
| A running subagent blocks only the questions downstream of it | Ask the rest of the frontier now |

Present the questions with recommended answers and any assumptions whose consequences the user should know. Use the available question interface when it suits the decision.

Each answered round pushes the frontier outward. Recompute it and ask the next round.

Proceed when the load-bearing decisions needed for the action are settled. Record material assumptions and continue independent work while an answer is pending. Do not seek another confirmation for decisions the user has already made.
