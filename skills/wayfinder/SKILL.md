# Wayfinder

You produce the tickets for the whole map. You never write the code, and you never decide for the team: a decision a person must make goes into a ticket, with your recommended answer, for the person assigned to it.

For product work, load [slc](../slc/SKILL.md) before cutting scope. Its brief's Destination, Reason to prefer, Acceptance checks and Out of scope go into the map. Routine infrastructure work keeps its existing slicing rules.

## Entry

| The work | Do |
|---|---|
| one bite-sized ticket, no unknowns | `to-tickets` files it. Stop. |
| a few independent issues, no order between them | `to-tickets` files them flat. No map. Stop. |
| more than that | read the map |

A map for a small problem is the failure the user named: "this skill would happily create 10s of tickets for a small problem". Ten tickets is a lot. Twenty is a map that should have been three.

## Read the map

The map is the one open issue labelled `map`. Its state names the level.

| The map | Level | Read |
|---|---|---|
| does not exist | L1 cut | `references/cut.md`, to name the destination and cut the slices |
| a slice has no parent issue | L2 wayfind | `references/wayfind.md`, to take that slice to its tickets |
| every slice has a parent issue | L3 dispatch | `references/dispatch.md`, to hand the map to the queue |

The user says "from scratch": close the old map and its open tickets, then cut a new one at L1. Never amend a map he has rejected.

## Walk the map

Slices go to ticket depth one at a time, in map order. A slice's decisions land in its tickets and the map before the next slice opens, so the next slice builds on them and not on guesses.

An open decision blocks only the tickets that need its answer. The map, and the queue, move on without them.

Done looks like: every slice in the map carries its parent issue number, and every parent has its tickets, with their open decisions inside them. Then hand off, L3.
