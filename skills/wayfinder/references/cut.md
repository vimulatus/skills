# L1 — cut

Turn "build X" into an ordered list of slices, then write the map.

## 1. Name the destination

Name one coherent outcome and who benefits. Ask the user to choose when the request contains competing destinations.

## 2. Cut into slices

A slice is:

1. something a person, a dev, or a program can interact with
2. that gives someone named a value
3. that stands alone — nothing else has to land for it to be worth having
4. that does not split into two things which also pass 1-3

Apply rule 4 until it stops splitting. The smallest thing that still passes is the slice.

For product releases, each split must also preserve the SLC brief's destination and reason to prefer. Keep dependent capabilities together when splitting would break either. Login alone can improve an existing product; a new product's first release also needs the job users came to do.

Infrastructure has no slice of its own. It rides along inside the first slice that needs it.

| Candidate | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Auth | splits — not a slice |
| Add email and password login | slice |
| Add passkey login | slice |
| Add the user schema | fails 2 — it rides inside email and password login |
| Allow the user to send feedback | slice |
| Email that feedback to me | a second slice |
| `POST /feedback`, with no UI | slice — a program interacts with it |
| A feedback form that logs to the console | fails 2 — a fragment of a slice |
| Move the database from Postgres to SQLite | slice — you and ops get the value |
| Set up CI | slice — the devs get the value |
| Dark mode, where no theme system exists | one slice; the theme system rides along |

## 3. Order them

The first slice is the thinnest one the user would actually run. Each slice after it builds on what has landed.

## 4. Write the map

One issue, labelled `map`. Every ticket is a child of it.

<map-template>

## Destination

One sentence. A product release adds the SLC brief's Reason to prefer on one line, then its Acceptance checks, one per line.

## Slices

1. <title>
2. <title>
3. <title>

A slice gains ` — #<parent>` when its tickets are filed.

## Ideas

Everything the user said they might build. Unordered, one line each. An idea becomes a slice only when the user promotes it.

## Decisions

One line per answered question, with its answer.

## Out of scope

What the destination excludes.

</map-template>

Then read `wayfind.md` and take the first slice to its tickets.
