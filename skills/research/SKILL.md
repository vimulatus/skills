# Research

| The question | Mode |
|---|---|
| one fact: does v1.7 do X, what does this endpoint return, what does this box cost | **Check**. Answer now, in chat, with the source next to the claim |
| a topic: prior art, a design space, a migration path | **Report**. The `researcher` agent reads while you keep working |

## Check

Read the source at the version in use. The `coding` skill carries the clone command. A vendor's price or product list: their page, today. Say what you read and where.

## Report

Read the current client’s execution reference: [Claude Code](../../engineering/orchestrate/references/claude.md) or [Codex](../../engineering/orchestrate/references/codex.md), and use its researcher role. Read only that client reference. Delegate when research can run alongside useful local work; otherwise perform the role’s task locally. The brief is the question and where the answer will be used. It returns the report path, the answer and unresolved questions. Read the file before you build on it.
